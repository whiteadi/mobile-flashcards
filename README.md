Udacity mobile app -> Mobile Flash Cards, third project of React training
==================

---------------------
## Project Overview

For the UdaciCards project, you will build a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## Installation notes

The project was bootstrapped with `create-react-native-app`,
you can start it by:

* installing the dependencies - `yarn`
* running the development server - `yarn start`

## Notes

I used the GUI example of react (native) training fitness project.

Used extra than react native:

* react-navigation-is-focused-hoc -  HOC to expose props.isFocused for react-navigation. No Redux needed. BTW the app is not using Redux :)
